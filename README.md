## Challenges

1. Are buildings' energy efficiency performance affected by certain features, or any other exogenous environment factors?
   
   For example, how do factors like the age of housing stock, building materials, roofs, and construction styles affect energy efficiency ratings in different boroughs? What policy initiatives have different boroughs in London introduced to improve the energy efficiency of domestic properties? Are there disparities in energy efficiency ratings that could exacerbate fuel poverty in certain boroughs? To what extent can innovations in construction, such as green building materials and energy-efficient design, be used to improve the energy efficiency of homes in different boroughs?

2. Are urban parks or trees really playing a role promoting citizens' health, either physical health or mental health? 

   For example, how do urban parks improve environmental sustainability and contribute to biodiversity in cities? What is the impact of urban parks on improving air quality, and how does this benefit respiratory health? How do green spaces in urban areas help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression?

3. How the climate risks (e.g., flood, heatwave) affect urban livability? Could greenspace (e.g., parks) or trees help out?

   For example, how do parks manage stormwater and help mitigate the effects of urban flooding? How do parks help reduce urban heat island effects, and how might this contribute to better health outcomes in heat waves? How can parks be integrated into urban planning to create more livable, sustainable, and healthy cities? Can trees help London adapt to extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and heavy rainfall? What role do trees play in reducing surface runoff and preventing urban flooding? What economic benefits do trees bring to local businesses/retails in terms of attracting customers and increasing sales? 

4. How the urban transportation modes can better support sustainable economy development in metropolitan cities?

   For example, how the air quality alongside road network will improve towards 2030 sustainability goals (i.e., PM2.5, PM10, NOx), with predicted future mobility scenarios? How it will then pose influences on local banks and retails site selections? What are the optimal combination of transport modes for citizens living in different London areas to get access to different types of services within 15 minutes, in the aim for sustainability?

5. How the urban waste management contribute to cities' sustainability goals towards 2030 and 2050?

   For exmaple, what role do waste-to-energy (WTE) facilities play in managing urban waste, and how effective are they in reducing landfill use? How effective is urban recycling in reducing waste sent to landfills, and what barriers exist to improving recycling rates among boroughs? What role do smart waste management technologies, such as IoT sensors and data analytics, play in optimizing waste collection and disposal in cities at localised scale?
