## Challenges

1. Are buildings' energy efficiency performance affected by certain features, or any other exogenous environment factors? (e.g., building's age, number of floors, materials, roofs, etc.) - contributed by _Dr Georgia Panagiotidou_.
2. Are urban parks really playing a role promoting citizens' health? - contributed by _Dr Linus Dietz_.
3. How the climate risks (e.g., flood, heatwave) affect urban livability? -
4. How the urban transportation modes can
**Possible Parks Questions?  Mentor - Linus Dietz** <br>
•	How do urban parks improve environmental sustainability and contribute to biodiversity in cities? <br>
•	What is the impact of urban parks on improving air quality, and how does this benefit respiratory health?<br>
•	How do parks manage stormwater and help mitigate the effects of urban flooding?<br>
•	How do parks help reduce urban heat island effects, and how might this contribute to better health outcomes in heat waves?<br>
•	How do green spaces in urban areas help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression?<br>
o	(Using Mental Health data from previous Data Dive?) <br>
•	How can parks be integrated into urban planning to create more livable, sustainable, and healthy cities? <br>
**Trees & London Case Study Possible Questions:**<br>
•	Can trees help London adapt to extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and heavy rainfall? <br>
•	What role do trees play in reducing surface runoff and preventing urban flooding?<br>
•	What economic benefits do trees bring to local businesses in terms of attracting customers and increasing sales? <br>
**Urban Waste Management Possible Questions**:<br>
•	What role do waste-to-energy (WTE) facilities play in managing urban waste, and how effective are they in reducing landfill use?<br>
•	How effective is urban recycling in reducing waste sent to landfills, and what barriers exist to improving recycling rates in cities?<br>
•	What role do smart waste management technologies, such as IoT sensors and data analytics, play in optimizing waste collection and disposal in cities?<br>
**Energy Efficiency & Poverty related**<br>
•	How do factors like the age of housing stock, building materials, and construction styles affect energy efficiency ratings in different boroughs?<br>
•	What initiatives have different boroughs in London introduced to improve the energy efficiency of domestic properties?<br>
•	How successful have government-led programs, such as the Green Homes Grant or ECO (Energy Company Obligation), been in improving energy efficiency ratings in London's homes?<br>
•	Are there disparities in energy efficiency ratings that could exacerbate fuel poverty in certain boroughs?<br>
•	How can innovations in construction, such as green building materials and energy-efficient design, be used to improve the energy efficiency of homes in different boroughs?<br>
