# Data-Dive-2025

The data repository for CUSP London Data Dive 2025: Sustainable Cities (February 2025).

- Industrial Partners: [Crown Estate](https://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/), [Geolytix](https://geolytix.com/)

## Challenges

1. Are buildings' energy efficiency performance affected by certain features, or any other exogenous environment factors? (e.g., building's age, number of floors, materials, roofs, etc.) - contributed by _Dr Georgia Panagiotidou_.
2. Are urban parks really playing a role promoting citizens' health? - contributed by _Dr Linus Dietz_.
